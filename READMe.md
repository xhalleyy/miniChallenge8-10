- Rehashed Combine concepts/ assignments. Used Random().Next() to generate a random index. Also utilized arrays and refreshed myself on how to declare and initialize arrays. Used bracket notation to obtain the value at a certain index. 

- Peer Reviewer & Comments: Zachary Dressel, Code functions properly and all endpoints match requirements. I would remove the default new API Weather files from the project, as well as format the service and interface files into their own individual folders. Overall very good!
